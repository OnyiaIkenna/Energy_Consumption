Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing AEDC and diesel energy consumption, cost trends, and usage patterns.
This project showcases a series of Power BI dashboards analyzing electricity (AEDC) and diesel generator usage for NIGCOMSAT over multiple time periods, including November 2023 to date and a detailed May–June 2025 breakdown.

The goal of these dashboards is to provide a clear, data-driven view of how much energy is consumed, how costs fluctuate, and how diesel usage compares to grid electricity over time.

Project Highlights
Long-Term Analysis (Nov 2023 – Present)
Total AEDC Cost: ₦125.26M

Total Diesel Cost: ₦184.5M

Key Trends:

Seasonal spikes in both AEDC and diesel costs.

Diesel costs occasionally surpass AEDC during generator-heavy periods.

Clear monthly cost and consumption breakdowns.

Detailed Monthly View (May – June 2025)
May 2025:

AEDC Cost: ₦8.17M

Diesel Cost: ₦18M

June 2025:

AEDC Cost: ₦9.05M

Diesel Cost: ₦13.8M

Side-by-side daily comparisons of kWh (AEDC) vs liters (Diesel) consumption.

Tools & Methods
Power BI Desktop for dashboard design and DAX calculations.

Microsoft Excel as a data source and preprocessing tool.
